# Change hostname

In Ubuntu for changing hostname one needs to change /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname file.
Instead of doing the changes manually, the bash script in this repository can be used to automate it.

After clone, change the file permissions to make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x change_hostname.sh
```

Execute the file as:
```bash
./change_hostname.sh
```
